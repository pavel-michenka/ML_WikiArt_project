# **Machine Learning - Jan Platoš** 

## **Course Overview** 

This course is a practical introduction to deep learning. Starting from the basics of deep neural networks and gradient descent, it covers convolutional networks for images, recurrent networks and transformers for sequences and text, autoencoders and generative models, object detection and time series analysis. Students build and train their own models in PyTorch and apply them to a self-chosen dataset throughout the semester. 

## **Semester Project** 

### **Project Philosophy & AI Policy** 

- **Individual project:** every student works independently on their own dataset and pipeline 

- **The "Native PyTorch First" rule:** because AI can easily write training loops and modern wrappers hide the underlying mechanics, you must demonstrate mastery of core PyTorch primitives — tensor operations, torch.autograd, nn.Module, forward passes, loss calculation, backward pass, and optimizer steps 

- **High-level frameworks** (PyTorch Lightning, Hugging Face, etc.) are permitted only in Milestone 2, provided that (1) the Milestone 1 baseline was built entirely in pure PyTorch, and (2) you can thoroughly defend and explain the underlying mechanics the abstraction handles (gradient accumulation, distributed hooks, batch collating) 

- **The "whiteboard / shape" defense:** at the defense you will be expected to write down and explain the exact tensor dimensions — (B, C, H, W) or (B, T, D) — at each layer transition, explain why gradients explode or vanish in your architecture, and modify forward passes on the fly 

### **Dataset Selection Deadline: Week 3** 

You may choose data from any domain — Computer Vision, NLP, Audio, Multimodal, or complex time series/tabular. However, the dataset must justify using deep learning over classic tree-based algorithms. Every proposal must meet the following measurable requirements: 

|**Modality**|**Minimum size**|**Structural constraint**|
|---|---|---|
|Computer Vision|≥ 5,000 images|Multi-class (≥ 5 classes) or complex regression/<br>segmentation/detection|
|NLP / Text|≥ 10,000 documents or<br>sequences|Requires subword tokenization, vocabulary mapping, or<br>custom embeddings|
|Audio / Speech|≥ 3 hours of audio clips|Requires on-the-fly or offline spectrogram / MFCC<br>extraction|
|Time Series /|≥ 50,000 time-steps /|High-frequency or multi-variate sequential dependency|
|Sequential|observations|(not static tabular data)|



- **Strictly prohibited:** standard tutorial datasets natively bundled with standard libraries without significant structural alteration (e.g. vanilla MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, IMDb sentiment, Iris, Boston Housing) 

- **Encouraged:** domain-specific datasets, data collected from past projects or bachelor thesis research, or Kaggle challenge datasets (post-competition) 

### **Milestone 1: Data Pipeline & Baseline Model Weeks 6–7** 

**Goal:** establish a working, bug-free end-to-end training pipeline in pure PyTorch. 

**Deliverable:** a fully runnable Jupyter Notebook or clean Python code, verified during an in-class consultation. 

- **Custom dataset & dataloaders:** subclass `torch.utils.data.Dataset` implementing custom `__len__ and __getitem__;` instantiate a DataLoader with batching, shuffling and worker management; visualize at least one batch post-transformation (transformed image tensors, decoded tokens, or spectrograms with correct tensor shapes) 

- **Baseline architecture** (`torch.nn.Module`): implement a straightforward baseline network from scratch (e.g. a simple 2–3 layer CNN, a vanilla LSTM/GRU, or a shallow MLP); no pre-trained weights yet — the goal is to understand the model's unassisted performance 

- **Explicit training loop:** write the complete training and validation loops manually — `optimizer.zero_grad()`, `loss.backward()`, `optimizer.step()`, and metric accumulation across batches 

- **The overfit sanity check:** take a tiny slice of data (e.g. 8–16 samples) and show your model can overfit it to near-zero loss and 100% accuracy — this guarantees gradients flow correctly, labels match predictions, and the pipeline has no silent broadcasting bugs 

### **Milestone 2: Advanced Architecture, Optimization & Defense Weeks 11–12** 

**Goal:** elevate model performance using modern architectures, regularization, and advanced training techniques. 

**Deliverable:** a complete code repository, reproducible training logs, and a slide presentation. 

- **Architectural evolution** (pick at least one major direction): 

   - Option A — Transfer learning / pretrained weights: fine-tune an existing backbone (e.g. ResNet, ConvNeXt, BERT, ViT) with frozen base layers followed by gradual unfreezing and discriminative learning rates 

   - Option B — Modern custom architecture: implement advanced components from scratch (e.g. residual connections, multi-head attention, bidirectional recurrent layers, bottleneck blocks) 

- **Data enhancement & regularization:** dynamic data augmentation during training (e.g. Mixup, CutMix, Random Erasing, SpecAugment, or synonym replacement); structural regularization such as weight decay, dropout, DropPath, or layer/batch normalization 

- **Advanced optimization:** dynamic learning-rate scheduling (cosine annealing, OneCycleLR, warmup); gradient clipping if using sequential/recurrent setups; experiment tracking with plots (TensorBoard, Weights & Biases, or Matplotlib logs showing training vs. validation curves) 

- **High-level abstractions (optional):** you may refactor this milestone using PyTorch Lightning or Hugging Face Trainer, but you must be able to explain all hooks and configurations used 

- **Failure analysis:** analyze the top failure cases (e.g. plot the top-5 highest-loss samples or inspect confusion matrices) and explain why the network struggled with these particular instances 

### **Evaluation & Defense Protocol** 

The defense consists of an oral presentation and an interactive code/architecture review: 

- **Presentation** (approx. 7–10 minutes): problem setup, architecture diagram, ablation studies, and evaluation results 

- **Methodological defense:** walking through tensor dimensions throughout the network; justifying loss functions (e.g. standard cross-entropy vs. focal loss vs. BCEWithLogitsLoss); explaining the difference between training mode (`model.train()`) and evaluation mode (`model.eval()`) 

- **Live code inspection:** answering questions about random seeds, device placement (.to(device)), and preventing memory leaks in the validation loop (e.g. `torch.no_grad()`, `.detach()`, `.item()`)
